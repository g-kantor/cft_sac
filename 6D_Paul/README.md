# Welcome to the CFT SAC algorithm applied to the 6d (2,0) SCFT.
---

## Getting started

In this readme file we will describe how to quickly get started with using the
code. First things first, you will need to download a working version of the
code which can be done [here](https://github.com/Paul-Richmond/cft_sac_6d).

If you want to get the very very latest version (might be under development/not
too stable) you can always clone the repository.

## Running the Code

Running the code is super simple. All you have to do is run in the terminal:

`python3 run.py`

Note that the result of the code is written into the *current_result.txt* file.

## Changing the Code

All the parameters of the code are stored in the *hyperparameters.py* file.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- SciPy 1.8.0rc1
- Matplotlib
