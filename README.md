# Welcome to the CFT SAC algorithm.

## Getting started

In this readme file we will describe how to quickly get started with using the
code. First things first, you will need to download a working version of the
code which can be done [here](https://github.com/pake-jeralta/cft_sac/releases).

If you want to get the very very latest version (might be under development/not
too stable) you can always clone the repository.

## Running the Code

Running the code is super simple. All you have to do is run in the terminal:

`python run.py`

You might need to change "python" to "python3" depending on you installation of
Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
